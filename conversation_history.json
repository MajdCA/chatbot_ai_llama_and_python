Exporting pore pressure data.\n2. Viewing inclinometer layers on the map.\n\nI'll provide guidance for both:\n\n**Exporting Pore Pressure Data:**\n\nIf you've followed my previous instructions, and you're still having trouble exporting pore pressure data, can you tell me what specific issue you're facing? Are you getting an error message or is the export option not showing up?\n\n**Inclinometer Layers on the Map:**\n\nFor inclinometer layers on the map:\n\n* Have you checked that your site filter is set to \"Site B\" (as mentioned in my previous response)?\n* Ensure you've selected the correct date range for the data.\n* Try zooming in and out of the map to see if the inclinometers become visible.\n\nIf none of these suggestions help, please provide more details about what you're seeing on your screen. I'll be happy to assist further!"
